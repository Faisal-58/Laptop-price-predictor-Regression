# Laptop-price-predictor-Regression
The project is used for predicting the price of the laptop using different features. The target feature is Price and various are other features are used for traning of the machine learing models. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed for studying the correlation of the features with the target variable i.e. 'Price'. Features Engineering is also performed for extracting useful features from the available dataframe. The data is splitted into training and testing set and models are developed using different regression techniques. A voting regressor is used for enhancing the R2 score to a value of 0.88. Hyperparameter Tuning is also performed using the GridSearchCV method but considerable effect was not seen. Other params can be used and checked for improvement in the overall performance of the model. Further streamlit is used for predicting the laptop price.
